    <h3>Project Synopsis</h3>
    <p>
      The logistics industry is increasingly using autonomous mobile robots in environments where both mobile robots and humans are interacting and sharing space. Maintaining an efficient environment free from workplace accidents requires mutual understanding and communication between autonomous mobile robots and humans. But how this communication will take place is the core problem that our team intends to solve. By writing software that acts as an intermediary between the operating systems of these autonomous robots and humans, we can utilize information from the robot hardware sensors and visually display it in a manner recognizable and understandable to humans. We will interface with both the Robot Operating System ROS  and hardware displays mounted on the mobile robots to display the robotâ€™s understanding of its environment and its intended actions in a manner that is accessible to any person who has to interact with these machines. This will allow non-technical workers to have an intuitive understanding of the actions that are safe to take, and will create more efficient work conditions for one of the most important facets of our economy.
